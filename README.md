The SMA integration currently available in Home Assistant only supports devices that use the Webconnect standard.

This integration supports almost all SMA devices like inverters, hybrid inverters, battery inverters and energy meters.


# Supported Devices
* (as before) Webconnect devices
* EnnexOS-based devices (currently e.g. Tripower X)
* Devices with a Speedwire-Interface
* Energy Meter (EMETER-10 + 20) and Sunny Home Manager 2

A list of devices that have been successfully tested can be found [here](https://github.com/littleyoda/pysma/blob/master/README.md)
